# Star Wars opening crawl from 1977

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL:[zhackerexploit](https://github.com/zhackerexploit) 

I freaking love Star Wars, but could not find a web version of the original opening crawl from 1977. So I created this one.



## Stuff I used:
 * CSS (animation, transform)
 * HTML audio (the opening theme)
 * SVG (the Star Wars logo from [wikimedia.org](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Star_Wars_Logo.svg) 
 * JavaScript (to sync the animation/audio)
